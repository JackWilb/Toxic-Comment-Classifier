# Toxic-Comment-Classifier

### By Jack Wilburn and Rob Squire

Welcome to our undergraduate data science capstone project, Natural Language Processing In R: A Wikipedia Case Study. This project represents a semester of work and is the culmination of our data science learning at Westminster College. Our goal for this project was to classify Wikipedia comments into 6 categories (toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate) and we were able to do so with a reasonable degree of accuracy (up to a 50% increase over the no information rate).

Please feel free to look at our files in this folder but the most accessible/readable version of this case study is in the FinalPaper.nb.html file. Also, we're open to feedback and questions at: jackwilburn@tutanota.com and rob.v.squire@gmail.com.

Thanks.
